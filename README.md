## Abstract
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a form of dementia that affects millions of people across the globe. There is currently no cure for AD; however, early diagnosis of AD will allow for treatment and disease management to begin before the severity progresses too far. Language deficits are a common symptom of AD and can occur at the earliest stages of the disease. To assist in early detection of AD, the present study investigates differences in language between two groups, AD patients and healthy control, by using speech features from previous work. Specifically, we build machine learning models on  speech samples from three language tasks (picture description, reading aloud and memory recall) in order to classify between AD patients and healthy controls. The best classification results are achieved by training a model with the combined features from all three tasks (AUC = 0.65, accuracy= 0.67). The findings from the present study are exploratory and show that our model was able to distinguish between healthy controls and AD participants. This indicates that speech analysis may be a viable tool for early AD detection that should be further explored and validated.
